10,"In the United States, a state college or state university is one of the public colleges or universities funded by or associated with the state government. In some cases, these institutions of higher learning are part of a state university system, while in other cases they are not. Several U.S. territories also administer public colleges and universities."
11,"Although most of these institutions are associated with state governments, a small number of public institutions are directly funded and governed by the U.S. federal government, including the service academies, the Community College of the Air Force, the Naval Postgraduate School, the Air Force Institute of Technology, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, military war colleges and staff colleges, and Haskell Indian Nations University. A few universities - Georgetown University, Gallaudet University, Howard University, and American University - are private universities in the District of Columbia that are federally chartered by the United States Government."
12,"Most state universities receive at least part of their funding from the state, although many have substantial income from tuition and fees, endowment proceeds, donations (such as from alumni or philanthropists), and revenue from royalties. State universities usually offer lower tuition costs to in-state residents. According to the College Board, public four-year colleges charge on average $7,605 per year in tuition and fees for full-time in-state students and $11,990 for out-of-state students.[1] Substantial financial support is also provided by the federal government, particularly through federal financial aid."
13,"In some states, e.g. Maryland, Tennessee, Indiana, and Washington, there is a campus designated as the ""flagship"" campus in the state's university system, which generally is the most prestigious campus and the largest campus in student population, e.g. the University of Maryland, College Park campus in the University System of Maryland, the Indiana University Bloomington campus in the Indiana University System, the University of Tennessee, Knoxville campus in the University of Tennessee System, and the University of Washington's Seattle campus in the University of Washington System. However, in some other states, there is no officially recognized flagship campus.[2]There are a number of states that have more than one university system, e.g. California with 2; Colorado with 2; Indiana with 2; New York with 2; Tennessee with 2; and Texas with 6 (the most)."

39,"As a general rule, schools are not alphabetized by their complete names, but rather by the names by which they are normally called. For example, in a list alphabetized by normal rules, ""Auburn University"" would precede ""University of Alabama,"" but the schools are virtually always referred to in popular conversation as ""Auburn"" and ""Alabama"" (followed by a campus identifier if required by the context). Therefore, in this article, ""Alabama"" precedes ""Auburn""."
40,"The list includes some of the more common academic nicknames or acronyms used for certain colleges or universities, e.g. ""Ole Miss"" for the University of Mississippi, ""Idaho State"" for Idaho State University, or ""UNF"" for the University of North Florida, not the ""Rebels"", ""Bengals"", or ""Ospreys"", respectively."
41,"To minimize any confusion regarding acronyms, either the first school listed or the school that is more nationally known having an acronym the same as another has the acronym provided, e.g. San Diego State University has the acronym ""SDSU"" included because it is listed before South Dakota State University, and Arizona State University has the acronym ""ASU"" given because it is better known nationally than Alabama State. In addition, only acronyms that are unique are given, e.g. ""UW Tacoma"" for the University of Washington's Tacoma campus or ""UNH"" for the University of New Hampshire."
42,"The list also includes schools that grant first-professional doctorates only (e.g., medical schools, law schools, or veterinary schools) that are independent of any other school in a state system."
43,"Satellite campuses that do not have accreditation separate from the mother institution are not included in the list, e.g. University of Washington Tacoma remains an integral part of the University of Washington, which is based in Seattle. On the other hand, institutions like University of Houston-Downtown and University of California, Santa Cruz are provided separate entries as they are considered independent, autonomous institutions."

The United States Federal Government provides tuition grants to District of Columbia residents through the DC Tuition Assistance Grant (DC TAG) towards the difference in price between in-state and out-of-state tuition at public four-year colleges/universities and private Historically Black Colleges and Universities throughout the U.S., Guam, and Puerto Rico. Small amounts of the grant can be used for Washington Metropolitan Area private universities within close proximate of the District.[3]"
